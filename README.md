# Study AI Agent 
AIKR S2026 Project - StudyChingu

We implimented a goak based agent that reads uploaded student notes and helos you through your learning journey through flashcards, quizzes, doubts solving agent and a custom time table planner.


## Project Description
Our agent is a web-based application built with Streamlit that acts as a personalised study assistant. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to ground all answers in the student's own uploaded material, a forward chaining rule engine to detect weak topics and prioritise subjects, and a CSP-based scheduler to generate optimised study timetables.

### Features
- **Note Maker** — Upload a PDF → get clean structured revision notes with headings and tables
- **Doubt Answering** — Ask any question → get an answer grounded in your own notes
- **Quiz Generator** — Auto-generates MCQs from your material, scores answers, tracks weak topics
- **Flashcards** — Generates Q&A flashcard pairs you can flip through
- **Smart Timetable** — Rule engine + CSP scheduler builds a personalised study plan
- **Progress Dashboard** — Tracks scores over time, identifies weak topics, shows streaks

### AI Techniques Used
- Knowledge Representation (JSON knowledge base)
- Forward Chaining Rule Engine (6 production rules)
- Constraint Satisfaction Problem solver (CSP timetable scheduler)
- Retrieval Augmented Generation / RAG (keyword-based)
- Attached Large Language Model (Groq — Llama 3.3-70b-versatile)

## Example Input / Output

### Note Maker
**Input:** Upload `Biology_Chapter3.pdf`, click "Generate Notes"  
**Output:**
```
## Cell Division
### Mitosis
- Produces 2 identical daughter cells
- Occurs in somatic cells
- Phases: Prophase → Metaphase → Anaphase → Telophase

### Meiosis
- Produces 4 genetically unique cells
- Occurs in reproductive cells
...
```

### Quiz Generator
**Input:** Upload notes, type subject "Cell Biology", click "Generate Quiz"  
**Output:** 5 MCQs generated from the uploaded notes  
```
Q1: What is the primary function of the mitochondria?
  A: Protein synthesis
  B: ATP production  ← correct
  C: DNA replication
  D: Lipid storage

Explanation: Mitochondria produce ATP through cellular respiration...
```

### Timetable Generator
**Input:** Subjects: Biology (weak), Physics (exam in 2 days), Maths (strong). Free slot: 09:00–11:00  
**Output:**

| Time | Subject | Duration | What to do |
|------|---------|----------|------------|
| 09:00–09:50 | Physics | 50 min | Attempt 10 past paper questions on Newton's Laws |
| 09:50–10:00 | Break | 10 min | Rest, stretch, or drink water |
| 10:00–10:40 | Biology | 40 min | Review mitosis vs meiosis diagrams |
| 10:40–11:00 | Maths | 20 min | Practice differentiation problems |

Rule firing trace: `critical_exam` fired for Physics (exam in 2 days, avg 58%)

## AI Tool Usage Declaration

- **Claude (Anthropic):** Used for project planning and initial scaffolding and code debugging. Core logic written by team.
- **Groq / Llama 3.3:** Used inside the application at runtime as the LLM brain.

All team members understand and can explain every line of code in their modules.
